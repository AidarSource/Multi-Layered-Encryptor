# Multi Layered Encryptor

Work in progress. 

# Main idea

Multiple encryption is the process of encrypting an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or a different algorithm. It is also known as cascade encryption, cascade ciphering, multiple encryption, and superencipherment. Superencryption refers to the outer-level encryption of a multiple encryption.

# Features

128 bit encode with 100 algorithms
i can try to 256 bit . . . . butttt :D to encode 256 bit need big machine i think, i'll try it
